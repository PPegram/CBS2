# 🎯 Cultural Bias Shield - Gemini Code Assist Integration Guide

**How to leverage Gemini Code Assist for advanced cultural bias detection**

---

## 🧠 Gemini Code Assist Integration Strategy

Since you have access to **Gemini Code Assist** (not Cloud Assist), here's how to maximally leverage it for your hackathon solution:

### 1. Code Generation Workflow

**Use Gemini Code Assist to generate:**
- Advanced bias detection patterns
- Cultural scoring algorithms  
- Natural language processing functions
- Data analysis and visualization code

### 2. Prompt Examples for Code Assist

#### Generate Bias Detection Patterns
```
Prompt: "Generate Python regex patterns to detect cultural bias in marketing content, focusing on Western-centric assumptions, religious bias, and economic assumptions"

Expected Output: Advanced regex patterns for bias detection
```

#### Create Cultural Scoring Algorithm
```
Prompt: "Create a Python function that scores text alignment with Hofstede cultural dimensions using keyword analysis and semantic matching"

Expected Output: Sophisticated cultural alignment calculation
```

## 🔧 Enhanced Implementation Using Gemini Code Assist

### Step 1: Advanced Bias Pattern Generation

**Prompt Gemini Code Assist:**
```
"Generate comprehensive Python regex patterns for detecting cultural bias in marketing content. Include patterns for:
1. Western-centric assumptions
2. Religious/holiday bias  
3. Economic assumptions
4. Gender role stereotypes
5. Age-related bias
6. Family structure assumptions
7. Educational assumptions
8. Technology access assumptions

Format as Python dictionary with severity scores."
```

### Step 2: Sophisticated Cultural Analysis

**Prompt Gemini Code Assist:**
```
"Create a Python class that analyzes text for cultural alignment using:
1. Hofstede's 6 cultural dimensions
2. Keyword frequency analysis
3. Semantic similarity scoring
4. Context-aware cultural mapping
5. Confidence interval calculations

Include methods for generating recommendations and cultural insights."
```

### Step 3: Advanced Scoring Algorithms

**Prompt Gemini Code Assist:**
```
"Generate a Python algorithm that:
1. Calculates cultural alignment scores with statistical confidence
2. Provides weighted scoring based on cultural dimension importance
3. Generates country-specific recommendations
4. Creates risk assessment with severity levels
5. Includes cultural context explanations"
```

## 📊 Code Assist Enhanced Features

### 1. Smart Pattern Recognition
```python
# Gemini Code Assist generated advanced patterns
ENHANCED_BIAS_PATTERNS = {
    "temporal_bias": [
        r"\b(modern|contemporary|up-to-date)\s+(lifestyle|values|thinking)\b",
        r"\b(traditional|old-fashioned|outdated)\s+(ways|methods|approaches)\b"
    ],
    "technology_assumptions": [
        r"\b(smartphone|social media|internet)\s+(access|usage|adoption)\b",
        r"\b(digital|online|cloud-based)\s+(first|native|savvy)\b"
    ],
    "lifestyle_bias": [
        r"\b(work-life balance|flexible schedule|remote work)\b",
        r"\b(disposable income|leisure time|vacation)\b"
    ]
}
```

### 2. Advanced Cultural Scoring
```python
# Code Assist generated sophisticated alignment calculation
def calculate_cultural_alignment_advanced(self, content, country_dimensions):
    """
    Advanced cultural alignment using multiple factors
    Generated with Gemini Code Assist
    """
    # Semantic analysis weights
    dimension_weights = {
        'power_distance': 0.15,
        'individualism': 0.25,  # Higher weight - most impactful
        'masculinity': 0.15,
        'uncertainty_avoidance': 0.20,
        'long_term_orientation': 0.15,
        'indulgence': 0.10
    }
    
    # Multi-factor scoring approach
    scores = {}
    for dimension, weight in dimension_weights.items():
        keyword_score = self._analyze_keywords(content, dimension)
        context_score = self._analyze_context(content, dimension)
        semantic_score = self._semantic_similarity(content, dimension)
        
        combined_score = (keyword_score * 0.4 + 
                         context_score * 0.3 + 
                         semantic_score * 0.3)
        
        scores[dimension] = combined_score * weight
    
    return sum(scores.values())
```

### 3. Intelligent Recommendation Engine
```python
# Gemini Code Assist generated contextual recommendations
def generate_smart_recommendations(self, content, cultural_analysis, country):
    """
    AI-generated recommendations using cultural psychology
    """
    recommendations = []
    
    # Dimension-specific recommendations
    for dimension, score in cultural_analysis.items():
        if score < 0.6:  # Low alignment threshold
            rec = self._get_dimension_specific_advice(dimension, country, score)
            recommendations.append(rec)
    
    # Content-specific suggestions
    content_suggestions = self._analyze_content_improvements(content, country)
    recommendations.extend(content_suggestions)
    
    return sorted(recommendations, key=lambda x: x['priority'], reverse=True)
```
